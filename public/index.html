			<h2 class="py-4">Why you should use WingJS</h2>

			<p class="text-center pb-3">
				WingJS is a JavaScript framework that makes it easier to develop web applications.
				It is designed to provide a comprehensive set of tools and features that make it easier to build dynamic,
				scalable, and high-performance web applications.
			</p>
			<p class="text-center pb-3">
				WingJS is built using TypeScript, a statically typed programming language that is a superset of JavaScript.
				This allows WingJS developers to write high-quality and maintainable code. The framework uses a component-based architecture,
				which allows developers to build reusable UI components and structure their applications in a modular way.
			</p>
			<p class="text-center pb-3">
				WingJS provides powerful features such as two-way data binding, dependency injection, and a comprehensive set of tools for building forms,
				handling HTTP requests, and testing. The framework's change detection mechanism updates the UI efficiently, 
				reducing the number of re-renders and improving the overall speed of the application.
			</p>
			<p class="text-center pb-3">
				WingJS has a large and active community that provides a wealth of resources, including tutorials, videos, and forums.
				The framework also has a rich ecosystem of plugins and libraries that developers can use to extend the functionality of their applications.
			</p>
			<p class="text-center pb-3">
				If you're looking to build complex and dynamic web applications, WingJS is a great choice. Its combination of performance, 
				ease of use, and versatility make it a popular choice for many developers. 
				Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, WingJS is a framework that is sure to meet your needs.
